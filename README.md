Controller For LANDesk
===
A bare bones browser powered by CefSharp and the Chromium Embedded Framework for use with LANDesk. The LANDesk client allows Chrome shortcuts to take over and disconnect the computer. Using this client instead ignores the shortcuts in Chrome and allows for a more pleasant remote control experience.
